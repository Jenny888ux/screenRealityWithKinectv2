Screen Reality with KinectV2
====

This project is made for to learn 3D geometoria and exercise coding and using library and kinect.  
You can get experience of VR with normal display. 
We have been impressed the VR application as [this art](http://blog.manfredas.com/3d-display-simulation-using-head-tracking-with-microsoft-kinect/, "3D Display Simulation using Head-Tracking with Kinect") and [this art](https://github.com/agirault/screenReality/blob/master/main.cpp, "screenReality").
So, We have tried to make the VR screen with processing and KinectV2.
